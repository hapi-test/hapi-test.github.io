I came to Cuisine du Cambodge with somewhat high expectations given the Yelp reviews and some very strong recommendations from friends and family alike, and, food-wise, I think the restaurant largely met those expectations.  The Shrimp Roll appetizer was good, though it was overcooked and I can't say I was a fan of the unexpected mayonnaise-based sauce hidden inside.  The Beef Loc Lac was a solid beef and onion combination dish and goes well with the included fried rice (which, at $9.95, is quite a value).  I really enjoyed, though, the Somlaw Machou Kreoung (aka Sour Fantasy Stew), which we were warned featured ""really strong flavors.""  When served over the accompanying white rice, those flavors--highlighted by the lemon grass--get soaked up into the rice and, as a result, a little more evened out.

The reason for the 2-star review, however, was the unfortunate and growing collection of used plates (multiple stacks, some four or five high) on several tables in the small dining room that remained unbussed throughout our dinner.  At least as a matter of hygiene if not aesthetics, it's an issue with a simple solution that should be addressed.  If not for that problem, given the good combination of authenticity and value, Cuisine du Cambodge would have merited a strong 3-star rating.
