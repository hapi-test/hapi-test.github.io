Big disappointment.  Food didn't taste fresh, and it was lukewarm. Randy, our server,  clearly doesn't like his job. He just went through the motions, and had a robotic personality.  Food and drinks are overpriced for what you get. Not to mention, the drinks are lucky to have a half of a shot of liquor in them. Jimmy Buffett himself would be extremely pissed to try and get wasted away with any one of the drinks at this place. Save your money and try ANY of the other restaurants\/bars on this ""strip"". Or better yet, save your money and go to Vegas Margaritaville for a much more authentic Jimmy Buffett experience.
