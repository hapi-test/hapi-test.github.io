Yesterday evening came into store to get fried chicken. It was dinner time and they out only had a couple pieces of fried chicken. They did dropped some more but had to wait 15 minutes. I walked around and was amazed at the high prices?  Wife says she will not shop will at this store will go to Von's or Walmart due to prices. I noticed the sale prices were most of time regular price?? Positive note is you can park close to door because no one in shopping in the store and no lines at checkout.  Deli personal were VERY helpful thank you.
