The absolute worst customer service.  I spent $156 in RC parts to include a set of TRAXXAS JATO Front and Rear Wheel sets as a Christmas present to a family member.  As it turns out, the wheel set was purchased in error and asked for a refund ($33\/set).  Upon calling the day after Christmas to see if the store was open, I was surprised at the lack of customer service and overall rudeness of the store manager (for which his father is the owner).  He said, ""don't you read the reciept...no exchanges for store credit only"". I said that how would I know that if the reciept is handed to me after the purchase...not before.  He then said, ""It's a store policy not to provide refunds... it's written on the back of our register"".  Again, I don't normally read everything posted in a store.  Why didn't they inform me verbally of this policy before purchasing the items?  The overall demeanor of this guy was absolutely unacceptable and I will NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM THIS STORE AGAIN!  I would NEVER recommend anyone to go there.  You'll find prices and service much cheaper online.  Read these reviews and you'll see that Hobby Town USA in Gilbert Arizona don't deserve OUR business.  I ususally don't bother with reviews, but these people pushed me over the line....I will do my best to place my honest review in every site available to expose the truth about this business.  Next call will be to the Hobby Town corporate office...they need to know that their name is being trashed in AZ.
