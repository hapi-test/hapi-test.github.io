This is one of the most horribleness location due to the service I had today , I went to there to check tire pressure it was showing low in the car reader, a guy named mike ( who is older gentleman with a long beard ) didn't have patience at all I asked him what's wrong with the tire he said how would I know, I said can you please check it and let me know what's wrong , he did something with the  valve with a screw driver and said you tire is not holding pressure when the tier was low to begin with not flat , I took it to a different place they said they he closed the valve of the tire and due to that it wasn't letting air in 
Went back to let the management know about their tech poor job and unprofessional behavior the guy in the front disk name ( argunein) I'm not going really sure of his name because I called back to get there names and reported to the BBB 
I have everything on a body camera and 3 calls recorded because that's not my first time treated poorly there before by 2 different people that's why I decide to put a body camera
