Okay, we are officially done with this Chipotle location. We've tried. We keep thinking the management will get the team trained, but it never happens. Tonight I was 4th in line while an off duty employee stood and chatted with the staff, slowing down the line. There were plenty of staff working and a manager wondering around but the girl adding all the toppings kept having to leave her station to ask for the toppings to be refilled one by one. I watched our food sit on the counter getting cold for over five minutes while the line grew longer behind me and that manager never changed pace or behavior. When I got home with my food my Barbacoa was nothing but one solid piece of slimy fat. So this is one of several sub-par experiences and I just can't anymore. Shame really, because we love Chipotle in general as a healthy dining option.
