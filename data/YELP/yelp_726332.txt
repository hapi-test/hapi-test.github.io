I've been coming to Norterra Salon to get my hair cut and colored for over a year and I've always walked out happy.  Danielle Labatt is fantastic!  She listens really well and I love the way she cuts my hair.  She recently used a shine-treatment and I could really tell a difference in my hair.  I usually only get my roots colored and she matches the color perfectly.  Danielle and the front desk staff are really friendly and welcoming.  The salon is gorgeous and very clean. 
 There's always plenty of parking and the salon is really easy to find.  I highly recommend this salon and Danielle!  :)
