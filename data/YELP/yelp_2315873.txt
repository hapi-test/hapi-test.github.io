Are we right to be suspicious of cab drivers? I don't really know, but if you're arriving at the airport in Phoenix and need a cab, you will end up in a Yellow Cab. I hate the psychodrama of a cab ride. You kind of know where you're going; you probably don't know the best route. You beat yourself up for not being better prepared or more knowledgeable. If you're arriving in Phoenix, have a route planned!

On this cab ride, I tried to be proactive and pull up the directions on my phone. Maybe that was a mistake. I immediately noticed the dot that represented ""me"" was moving in the opposite direction of the recommended route, but I didn't speak up. When the cab driver got off an exit too early, I didn't speak up. I was a total cab wimp. I just sat in the back steaming and thinking I was being taken advantage of, but we made it to the hotel. The front desk clerk seemed to think the route we had taken wasn't terrible, so I felt a bit better. 

However, the condition of the cab didn't improve my impressions, and although, there was no problem taking my credit card, I thought it was presumptuous that the suggested minimum tip is 20%, 25% or 30%.
