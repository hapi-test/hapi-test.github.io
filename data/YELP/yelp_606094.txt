Another bad experience here at the dog haus.  This is my absolute last time ever coming here.  Ordered the soooo Cali dog. Awful, too much shit on it to even eat like a hot dog.  The sausage was even bad too.  Took forever to get my two dogs and was very disappointed.  Manager didn't give a shit about me not liking the food.  Can't recommend this place to anyone.  God awful all around.
