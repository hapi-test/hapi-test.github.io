After eight years and over 100 meals I ate here, I can say I have never had anything here that wasn't perfectly delicious! In the summer (when I'm working) I usually have their campachana a couple of times a week. No one else makes it this delicious! (I'm here having one now). They always give a very generous portion of shrimp and octopus. Mmm and always with a plentiful amount of creamy fresh ripe avocado. How do they manage to always have access to perfectly ripe avocados? Because in the store they are rarely ripe when you buy them. Lol I feel so good after eating their campechana! 

And THEN, their fresas con crema (strawberries & cream)! No one makes that better either! (Except I myself because I make it with honey.) 

They have a very diverse menu. They even have burria, which is great, just not quite as great as Adrian's. But I've been in love with this place for a long time and will undoubtedly continue to be a happy customer as long as these owners (it's a family business) are at the wheel.
