I'm very picky when it comes to fast food Mexican.  It can be simple but it has to be good.  This place had very  matter of fact service.  The food was done in a quick time frame but it just wasn't that cheap or that good to bother going back to.  Ordered a bean and cheese burrito with potato added to it.  The tortilla was delicious.  It smelled and tasted fresh made.  However it was a bit burned.  Then the beans were very average with thick shreds of cheddar cheese.  The potatoes were gross in my opinion.  They were very big chunks of breakfast style potatoes with lots and lots of pepper.  I am not a fan of pepper.  Also ordered the 5 rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole.  My children did not care for the ""meat"" in the middle.  The guacamole was a bit sour tasting.  I did like that the tacos were thickly rolled.  The outside was super crisp and the inside mushy.  That appealed to me....

We won't be back.
