Okay, wow.  This was the best food we had in Vegas.  Either that's saying something bad about the other places we ate or something great about this buffet.

To temper the review a bit, please know that we got there at 8am on New Year's Day ... we were one of the few people in the restaurant.  Maybe that is why service was great - our waiter was very attentive and our drinks were always full and our plates removed while we went to get the next.  We also didn't have a wait to get a table.

The food was amazing and tasty.  We sampled as much as we could fit in our stomachs - of particular note was the gnocchi (wife's favorite) and the honey-sriracha wings (mine).

The gelato was was the best I'd had while I was in Vegas -- the first with a REAL pistachio flavor.
