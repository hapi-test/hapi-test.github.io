La Bodega is a nice place in the Tremont area. I was looking for a sandwich and found this place as rated very high by fellow yelpers. 

I ordered their veggie pizza sub. It was huge, I ate it for lunch and dinner. It was very nice and juicy. I loved it. 

The place has some very weird art on display bot other than that the staff is very friendly. 

I will be coming here often.
