My friend was celebrating his BD with his family. My husband and I were excited to have been invited and to visit Maestro. The service was good but the food no big deal. My salad looked like a $4. It consisted of chopped iceberg n a bit of radicchio w\/ a bit of pickled peppers. The salmon was over cooked n dry. I returned it n they brought me the scallops but even that I was not able to eat. It was smothered in cream and it was overly salted. I did not sent it back but I did not eat it either. When dessert came, I took one bite and put my fork down. It was loaded n masked with lots of sugar not a good quality dessert. I didn't want to seem ungracious so I did not say anything to the people I was with. But I realized that Maestro is over rated with bad expensive food. I  commented to my husband that I would never go back there.  If I'm going to spend money for an experience, I would like to be able to at least enjoy the food. I know many restaurant that don't have the hype yet the food is worth so much more than what they charge bc is good food.
