Pio Pio..I was so excited for this place..I had not heard alot about it and when I found out it was Columbian food..I was thrilled...well, I went, tonight and I shall not be going back. Was it bad? No it was not really bad but was it good, No not that either. It was a strip mall shop that has chicken exactly like the Rotisserie Chicken from Harris Teeter only more expensive. We ordered the Whole chicken...but it was just he four pieces...two small breasts with part of a wing attached and two thighs..No idea where the legs went ---or why they were not included in the WHOLE chicken. Then I ordered the ChimiChurri Sauce...4 dollars. Wilkepedia describes Chimichurri as :Chimichurri is made from finely chopped parsley, minced garlic, olive oil, oregano, and white or red vinegar. Additional flavorings such as cilantro, paprika, cumin, thyme, lemon, and bay leaf. What we received was a small dish of chopped onion in water...no green anything. Very disappointed. The fried Tostones were very thin and crisp..I liked them but not enough to make me go back to Pio Pio...I will just get a chicken at Costco or Harry Teets if I am craving Rotisserie Chicken again...Sorry Pio Pio..you did not make my list!
