We went about 6 on a Thursday eve. Greater and seated immediately. The place is clean and very pleasant atmosphere. 
We had the scallops and steak salad for our entrees the charcuterie board for app and the chocolate flourless cake for dessert. 
Everything was fantastic. Portions size, how they were cooked, how they were served all on point. The service is attentive and friendly yet not irritating. 
They have great water too, water people will get what I'm saying. 
Only my second time to this long time gem (first time was great too) and we plan on returning.
