Gelato!  YUMMMMM.  I've been here twice thus far.  First, I was kind of disappointed.  I ordered a stratiatella and it was too cold.  One of the reasons why I like gelato is its creamy consistency.  Yesterday, I swung by for a scoop of bacio....it was pure heaven.  It isn't cheap but boy is it good.  Definitely will be back and I'm happy a nice place took over that random restaurant!
