Always my favorite spot to study, relax and have a sip of my favorite mocha treat! The ambience is so hippy that makes me always happy :)
Today, I tried their sandwich and learned that they are very similar with Cargo's. I think I read about it on other's review that these two places are sisters. 
I'll try to stick with the locals! They need to survive and they're fab too! 

*We actually were aimed to have some tea at Machatea but 4th of July has made most the coffee shops in Madison closed. But, Ground zero is never a bad idea. It's super!
