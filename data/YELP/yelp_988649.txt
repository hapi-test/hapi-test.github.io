if i had the option not to leave a  star i would!!!! i came here for my birthday i had a huge party the first server we had was rude second server seems like he didn't want to take our order we were on separate checks so i get it but u still have to do ur job plus we our a group that tips base on customer service which we didn't have! our server was told multiple times it was my birthday and i didnt get a song or the little desert which i really didnt care for but since he was told i figured he would have got it together. everyone was unhappy at fact that he wasnt attentive, we had to flag him down, not to mention the bathrooms were disgusting the whole dinner was a joke. my mother asked about the birthday celeb as we were leaving and he said well i asked the kids what was her name whaaaaaat.... there were 7 other adults you could have asked what about asking the person that advised u we had a birthday in the first place. my salmon was dry the broccoli was raw not steamed like i asked... it was issue after issues don't go to this location the best chilis i've been to so far is on las vegas and warmsprings or charleston and ft apache. they deserve my 60%-100% tip everytime!
