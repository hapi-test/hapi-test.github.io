This is one of my favorite Mexican food restaurant, I just love this place. I love their breaded fish tacos combination, it's to die for, I seriously love it. My husband and I almost always get the same thing, it is just delicious. Their Carne ASAda burritos, nachos, enchiladas, and quesadillas are really good too.
