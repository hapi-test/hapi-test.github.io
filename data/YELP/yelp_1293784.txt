Was told to be here for a drug screening mandated by work at noon. I get here at noon and they tell me I'm looking at a 45 minute wait. Receptionist seems very unfamiliar with her position. Very very frustrating experience. *** finally seen after over an hour wait. Nurse was nice but I hope I never have to come here again.
