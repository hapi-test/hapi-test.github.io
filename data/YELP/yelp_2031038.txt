I can honestly say I agree with the bad reviews about this family practice after the experience I had today with rescheduling an first time appointment with a office assistant. The woman had a very unprofessional and rude attitude with me when it came to rebooking the appointment, talked over me when I was talking, and then hung up. I am very glad that I had this experience because it demonstrates to me the mentality of the people who are operating this office. It's shame that they are not treating their patients with respect and professionalism.
