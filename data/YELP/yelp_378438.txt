This Starbucks was busy when I went. There was a convention for the NFR (national finals rodeo) that weekend. It had all kinds of different customers, from convention vendor personalle\/ workers because I saw badges around their necks. I ordered a hibascus, consistent in taste to other Starbucks, a little bit pricer (duh it's vegas). It was clean and there was free wifi available.
