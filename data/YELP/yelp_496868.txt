This is my very first time trying and hearing about this place. I was pleasantly surprised. It's like a subway, but I would say they have better prices. The bread is nice and soft and the portions to me are generous. I got a 6 inch and it was enough to keep me full. If you want to go bigger, then hey ! Be my guest! The location was clean, and I even used the bathroom- which was really clean ! Skip subway and go here if you get a chance.
