So unhappy with how our order was handled.  We ordered takeout and did not receive what we ordered. I called to make them aware, the girl answering the phone was very defensive.  In the midst of her answering the call, she said 3 different places and was laughing finally stated Carmella's. I kindly let her know our order was incorrect, she started yelling over me and wouldn't let me finish. I did my want a refund nor them bring other food out, just wanted to make them aware that order was incorrect in case someone else's order was the same. I finally decided to end conversation as she was so rude. Very disappointed in our food as well as how this was handled. She refused for me to speak with manager. We used to order something every week, we stopped about 3 months ago due to quality of good, decided to give another chance. This was the LAST chance. I hope they can get it together, it's a shame how it's being run into the ground and no one cares.
