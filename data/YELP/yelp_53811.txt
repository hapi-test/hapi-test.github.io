Went here looking at mattresses.  Only ""used mattresses"" that have been sanitized.  I will only purchase a new mattress, but need a box spring, they didn't even have matching sets for their king beds.  Not a great experience, but I didn't stay too long.  Staff was few in number so could really get much help.
