Very bad dinning experience. We have a group of 8 people. First, we were told to wait next to our table before being seated. Our table was perfectly set up, right next to us. No one explained why we had to stand there instead of just sit down for about 10 minutes. Then after we sat down, we waited for about a ridiculous hour before the food came up. The waitress show up about twice explaining there was issue in their kitchen operation. The food finally came. Nothing is special. I wouldn't have waited for 5 minutes had I know how mediocre the food was. As snacks, We ordered kettle chip nachos, which was almost cold when being served. The buffalo chicken wing is only comparable to frozen buffalo chicken wing from Costco. I ordered ultimate cheeseburger, it was at most ok. One of us ordered the crown burger. It turned out very salty. Even worse, he got stomach issue right after the lunch. Another person ordered Hell's Kitchen burger and also got stomach upset. We suspect the meat has problem. Thankfully both felt better after a couple of bathroom trips. If you go there, most likely you will see line waiting to be seated. My experience is it not worth waiting at all. Go to Burger King or McDonald's if you really want a burger. You can get equivalent or better quality of burger without the ridiculous waiting time. I would give 0 or negative star if there is such choice.
