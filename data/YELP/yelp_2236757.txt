Ok, so after hearing so much about this place & checking the reviews, my family and I finally got a chance to check this place out tonight...The drive thru-line was packed & so was the inside. I thought, this place must be great...We got two boxes of The Caniac which included: Cole slaw, Tx Toast, Fries, & 6 chicken fingers...We also got the Sweet tea...My verdict: Bland, Bland, Bland...Wow...I cannot believe how 
season-less this chicken was...Almost like they just threw it in the fryer...We've had better strips at Chili's...Fries: I love crinkle fries but these had no taste whatsoever...The cole slaw was just plain disguisting...Tasted stale. The Sweet tea & Tx Toast was the best thing in the combo...We drove pretty darn far to get to this place & now I'm pissed that I wasted my gas. Kids ate it but only because they were starving. My daughter said it was ehhh ok....Oh, almost forgot about the sauce which people said they couldnt live without. We even bought extras for $.31 cent a piece...Totally not good. Right now, I'm eating these chicken fingers with ketchup and threw a bunch of season on our fries when we got home...Maybe the other locations are better....
