I mean, I knew what I was getting in to... and I had even heard from others to pass on this place. But I decided to give it a try anyway. 

Now, I'm hardly a sushi snob, but honestly this is pretty easily the worst sushi I've ever had. Nothing about this place is quality. The rice was super dry, along with the chicken that I tried. I even got spicy mayo and chili sauce all over my sushi and it was still almost flavorless. 

The chop sticks here, oh my... I literally don't think you could buy cheaper chop sticks. Almost paper thin, I could snap them in half so easily. Plus, they were not smooth at all. Splinters ALL over them. The cups, the lids, everything just screams ""cheapest product we could buy"" here. 

All in all, I actually did want to like this place. But I definitely won't be back.
