I came here near the end of last summer, and I must say that the food wasn't the best I had. I ordered a burger that was dry and completely flavorless. It was as if they pressed minced meat, put it on the grill, put the patty in between two stale buns, slathered some ketchup on it, and voila!

A restaurant in such a lovely location with such a spectacular view should have food that accompanies the senses.

Mind you, I haven't tried all their food, so the rest of the menu could be better!
