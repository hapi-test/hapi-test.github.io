Pork Chop as under cooked, very pink inside. Had to send it back. When they brought it back to me, it appeared to have been placed in a microwave to finish cooking but it was still pink in the middle. The server told me it's ok now days to have pork pink. Needless  to say, I could not eat the under cooked pork so I ordered a dessert. Servers were nice and attentive.
