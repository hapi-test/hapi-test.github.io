An employee from this car wash stole my phone. My keys were in the same compartment as my phone and they were both taken. However, when I called twice and came back they had my keys  but said they never saw a phone. Little did they know I had a GPS tracking application on my phone (where's my droid) and it proved that it was in fact at the car wash but by the time I tracked it they were closed and would not answer their phone. Later that night I tracked my phone to an apartment right down the street from the car wash. It should be obvious at this point that it was stolen, but when I went back the next day to give the manager and every employee every chance to make it right, nothing was done. He was rude and dishonest. I called the police and it is still under investigation. In the mean time however, this has cost me a lot of money to replace my phone and a lot of my time. They refused to do anything to compensate me for my phone and did I mention the general manager never even came to talk to me and did not call back when I left a message about the incident. Do not go do here!
