I have been living in Toronto for 2 years now and I am a sushi addict, every month I need to eat sushi at least once or twice. Long story short, I ve been around the block looking for a good, affordable and flavorful suahi place. To-ne has all the ingredients for being one of he best place in toronto for affordable sushi. My husband and I eat around 25 pieces each and every time we eat there we leave totally full. The place is great, service is fast and above all the price is right...
