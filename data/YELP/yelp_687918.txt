Our experience with this company has been quite negative. They try to rip you off and only want your money. They will deceive you just to get it. Honestly, you should stay away from this company (the overall rating, at the time of this review, is only 1.5 stars for a reason).

When we attended the Orange County Fair last summer, one of Blue Chips Vegas sales representatives tried to convince my husband and I to attend a timeshare like presentation with this company so that we could earn a free 3 day and 2 night stay and enjoy a little mini vacation in Vegas. 

This guy tried to give the impression that he was really easy going and not trying to force us to buy anything, but just to go and check out what Blue Chips can offer us. We have gone to the Wyndham Hotel time share presentation thing once before so we knew what we were getting into. So we decided to just try it and then enjoy the rest of our free vacation... well the 3 day and 2 night stay is supposed to free anyway, we just have to put down $50 and then we were told we would be fully refunded after our presentation. 

Well we got home, my husband and I tried to make a reservation for a date to go and we were having all of this trouble with the company's representative in trying to get a date. So my husband decided he wanted a full refund on the $50 they already charged him. It took him several phone calls and many representatives later that he finally got his $50 back to his credit card.

Anyways, about this hotel in general, it is behind the MGM Grand Hotel (maybe 1- 1.5 miles behind) and it actually looked like a nice hotel when we drove by it several times. But because of our experience with this company in general, I am awarding this place with 1 star. 

Oh and just to let you know, this hotel is not dog friendly (but there are a handful of dog friendly hotels in Vegas, like Planet Hollywood, The Quad, Rio, Alexis Hotel, Motel 6, Bally's, Harrah's, Trump Hotel, etc)
