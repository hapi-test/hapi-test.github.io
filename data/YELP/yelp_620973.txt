LOVE this place!!!  BEST spa in Charlotte, hands down!!!  I came here on a whim looking for a gift certificate for my aunt and fell in love with this place.  The staff, both professional and behind the desk, were so helpful and nice.  They were extremely knowledgeable and you could tell they all really wanted to help.   In terms of the service experience, my Aunt and I absolutely loved it and have been back on a regular basis for all different kinds of services.  I can't thank the Spa staff enough for making us feel comfortable there... we love getting services but had trouble finding a spa that wasn't intimidating or pretentious which is the complete opposite of the Voci Spa.  This has been such a wonderful experience for us.... THANK YOU!!!
