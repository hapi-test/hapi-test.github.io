Okay, I rarely leave reviews, but I have to say a few words about this place.  My husband and I are always looking for delicious Indian food at a reasonable price-- This place is it!!!  I read a few reviews of this place and we decided to try it.  We walked in near closing time, wanting to order some takeout on the way home from the kids' soccer practice.  The chef\/owner was closing up and seemed ready to leave.  I almost turned around and walked out before we ordered, but the chef insisted that he was happy to take our order and he turned the grill back on and made our food.  I was impressed.  Then when he brought the food out to us, he explained that he is a chef-- not a cook-- and that he takes a lot of pride in his work. He confidently claimed that this was going to be one of the best Indian meals we've ever had.  Boy, was he right.  My husband couldn't even wait until we got home to try the food.  The moans and groans of delight as he stuck his fork inside one of the boxes, let me know that I was in for a treat.  We ordered the chicken tikka, lamb biryani, palak paneer and a few other things.  Absolutely fresh and delicious.  And get this?  They have a weekday lunch buffet for $10!!  Perfection.  The chef\/owner is new to Vegas from D.C.-- do yourself a favor and support this business.  You won't be disappointed.
