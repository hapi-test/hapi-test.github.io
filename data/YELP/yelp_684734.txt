I have been coming to this salon for a couple of years now.  In the last 8 months or so it has been the only place I have been going to unless I am tied up at work and have to go somewhere close to the office.  The service is very professional, a great experience every time.  Eva does my fills for me - very efficient and never a problem with 'lifting' as I have with other places.  Joanne does excellent nails and pedi as well.   Both of them are courteous and professional.  Salon is very clean.  They offer other services such as waxing, facial and massage.  All of which have been wonderful experiences for myself or my daughter.  You can also get RMT service there, which I have had and again been very happy with.  

Highly recommend this place.
