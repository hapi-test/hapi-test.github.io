I have been going to Black Locust Cafe for the past year. Every time it is better and better. Everything I have ordered is delicious and the service and ambiance is warm and welcoming. I highly recommend it for breakfast and lunch. In addition they have added Madison on Tap and Jardin. Madison on Tap is a great hang out bar also with comfortable seating and nice lighting and every month they highlight a new local brewery's beer.I love the place. I had dinner at Jardin recently and the food was delicious!! I don't know what else I can say, this place has everything and is in a great neighborhood , and they have a beautiful courtyard for outdoor seating!! This place is it! Great for a wedding or big party. Spread the word!
