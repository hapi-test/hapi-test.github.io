In the process of doing some Christmas shopping we had the opportunity to look around various video game stores in and around Chester and we found the best to be Gamestation.


 The staff are knowledgable and offer excellent advice without being too pushy. More importantly, the offers in store were by far the best on the high street and were comparable with ineternet offers.
