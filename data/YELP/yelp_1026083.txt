I wish I could give NO stars... At Phoenix Mesa gateway airport, Allegiant took over an hour to unload the luggage and begin the conveyer belt to distribute to passengers. When I called to report it, I left several messages with no return call and then when I finally got through to the airlines after holding for 32 minutes, the customer service member would not assist me and told me that he would not\/could not allow me to speak with a supervisor! He told me to write a letter and hung up on me as I was trying to ask him a question! VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!
