I love the fact that our city is getting all of these new and fantastic brewery's. I am not sure how the brewery's feel about it but I do not necessarily feel that each brewery is a competition. I think with more breweries it will help each other out by getting people into our city to spend a day hopping around breweries. 

After having Triple C brews a few times, I was excited that Yelp through an Elite event at the brewery. As I already knew I loved the beers, it was nice to see where it all gets made. The brewery itself is super cool. Very clean, modern, and fun. Ping pong, and Foosball tables were a welcomed surprise. Papi Queso on site for some grilled cheese sandwiches and a couple of beers, does not get much better then that. Can't wait to try the new brews coming out!
