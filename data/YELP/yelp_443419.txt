OMG, the food here is excellent, I love the salmon\/seafood dish I order and the Mac and Cheese! It's everything you would expect a 5 Star restaurant to be running by one of the most famous chef ever. Everyone in our group was happy with their meal. We all agreed it was one of the best meal we ever had. Fine dinning at restaurant like Table 10 is what makes our Vegas trip a little bit more memorial. 

Not only was the food delicious but it came out so pretty. I never really cared about how my food was being plated before, but the way Table 10 plated my dish it was just a 'work of art'. 

The service we had was wonderful. They made sure to always check up on us, had our waters filled and took care of us out through the whole dinner. They made our dinning experience here one of the best dinning experience ever. That's why whenever I'm in Vegas I always have to stop by to Table 10 for a meal.
