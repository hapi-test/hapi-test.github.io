This club is awesome! Hip Hop is so much better than edm, thank you Dj! My friends and I had a great time. The venue is nice and spacious and the air blasts\/streamers falling from the sky is exciting 

The bartenders need to get their shit together though (drink spilled on the birthday girl's dress from bartender knocking it over, she made her a new one but still had her pay $19\/ major attitude from bartender 2 after a small request I.e no sugar on the rim). 

That aside, I had a great time and would definitely come back.
