I thought this place was great! They have a good selection of tacos for both vegetarians and meat-eaters, and the michelada is actually tasty. I've been to some hipster Mexican restaurants that mess that drink up royally, and this is not one of them. 

Price wise, I would say this place is damn fair for the quality of the food. You might consider it spendy relative to some places, but the guac is also made tableside and the food is really really good, so it gets to be a little spendy.

The one thing that's kind of a bummer is that, being nestled into a side spot at The Yard, it's got a small floorplan relative to the demand for their tacos, especially on Tuesday. But if your least favorite thing about a place is that so many people like it you have to wait a bit for a seat, you're doing alright.

tl;dr Come for the Miches, stay for the tacos.
