It is a complete scam! Don't rent cars from them! Went to get the car and it was filthy dirty inside and out, gas was below 1\/2. I was coming back late for 2mins and they charged me $25 extra for late return! $25 is even more than I paid for the entire rental. Wonder how they make money with such low hourly rates? There you have your answer. They attract customers with their low rates but charge you in other ways.
