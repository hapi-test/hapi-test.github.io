If your new to Arizona or visiting, you gotta come here, its CHEAP, healthy and no need to dress up, they have take out also.  So when you go, you have to have their chicken with hummus, AMAZING and so damn tasty, I recommend the Lentil Fetoosh Salad, funny name, but the divine flavors are no laughing matter, also they have a honey glazed Pizza, Eat that one too and of course some Tzatsiki, so refreshing and light.  And if your a vegetarian or are a slob and have room for a good side dish, do their brown rice and lentils, there is just something about the seasoning that makes this a meal on its own, so you can even throw some grilled chicken on that and call it a night. Its really really really good.
