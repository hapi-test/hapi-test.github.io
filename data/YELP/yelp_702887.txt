My boyfriend and I were passing through Pittsburgh on a road trip. We had seen TV shows featuring primanti brothers sandwiches. They looked amazing on TV.  And we were really excited about them. However when we got to primanti brothers and received our sandwiches (I got the roast beef and he got the pittsburger) we realized there was hardly ANY MEAT on the sandwich. Or cheese for that matter. It was overloaded with coleslaw that we could hardly taste the meat. The pittsburger burger that came in the sandwich was so small that it was only towards the middle of the sandwich. Very over rated place. And the area near the bathrooms smelled like a pet store.
