I had a great time shopping with friends when we came here! There was plenty of parking (crucial) and it was super cute how some of the store buildings looked like miniature houses. My absolute favorite part though is the pond in the middle where you can feed the ducks and fish! They have these dispensers at various points around the pond where you can buy a handful of duck treats for $0.25! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the pond water was bright green and kinda milky. Weird. I'm not even sure how the fish could maneuver around in the water and know where they were. Also all but one of the dispensers needed to be refilled.
