This sushi restaurant is a nice little spot. The service is nice and friendly, and apparently they are really nice to their repeat customers. One of my friends really likes their ginger ice cream, but they don't always have it. I was with them there today, and they made some special for him. I appreciate places that are willing to break out the royal treatment for repeat customers.

For lunch I recommend the bento boxes. I have been here in the past and ordered their set of two rolls, or their salmon combination plate, and I was left unsatisfied because it just wasn't enough food for me... But the bento box comes with edamame, 4 pc veggie roll, soup, salad, and a pile of rice. The veggie roll wasn't totally cheap either, as it had avocado and a crispy exterior. I got the sushi and tempura bento box, and the variety of sushi was salmon, tuna, and some white fishes (one I think was sable\/butterfish, and I am not sure of the other one).  The sushi here is really fresh, and well prepared. The tempura is crispy and not oily.

I wouldn't call this place a cheap sushi joint. If you are looking for that, I would hit up one of the places along Bloor, between Spadina and Bathurst. Though there is a variety of fancier rolls that would be more appropriate for a 30 dollar dinner here.

Meals start with soup and salad, and end with a little scoop of ice cream.
