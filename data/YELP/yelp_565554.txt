I have to say they figured out apple pie!! The mix of pecans and caramel with the apples and pastry made it one amazing dessert. We sat in the bar area upstairs, and it was a great spot. I would have given 5 stars however it could be the result of sitting in the bar area, but the service was a little slow. Maybe next time I will sit in the dinner area!!
