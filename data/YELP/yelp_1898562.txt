Stayed here for the first time and wasn't very impressed.  The room was small and the first night we had lukewarm water even if we turned it up until it was supposed to be hot.  The next morning there was no hot water - only cold.  The walls are very thin as I could hear everything going on in the room next to us.  The only good thing about the room was the new carpet.
