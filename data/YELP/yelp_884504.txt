Sorry, YELP, you definitely failed me on this one. Turkey tips were fairly tender and decent. Rib tips were tough and chewy. Chicken legs were okay but nothing to go back for. It's obviously personal preference on sauce, but I found their sauce to be pretty bland. It didn't really have a BBQ flavor to it. Cornbread was kind of like cake but it tasted fine. I prefer cornbread that has actual corn in it. On a positive note, everyone working there was super nice. Unfortunately, I won't encounter them again.
