Took my 2000 Ford Ranger in for a trip check and oil change. AC was also out. I learned my front brakes needed replacing. Price was fair. They did not hassle me to get other work done that was not essential. Work was done quickly. I also liked that they have a rewards program. A couple weeks later, I took my wife's Jeep and service was also great. Also saved a couple bucks since I had rewards to use!
