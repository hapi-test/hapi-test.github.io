Got a massage done by Dave, it was a recently purchased Groupon, and well worth my money.
Dave was professional and extremely great at the massage! I felt better instantly after getting off the table and I fully intend to go back and see the actual chiropractor for a session (as I'm always having problems with my back and neck) and I will definitely be back for  another massage.
