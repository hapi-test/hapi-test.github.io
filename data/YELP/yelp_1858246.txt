Another Price Increase!!??  C'mon Dante, get serious!  This is take-out food you're peddling, not haute cuisine!

Obviously you've been eyeing the ridiculous price that Toronto yuppies are willing to drop on a plate of pasta with greed in your eyes, but if you wanna get over-the-top-dollar for some pasta, at least have the courtesy to open a chic trattoria like the others do.

I've never been wild about Dante's wet, sloppy, heavy pizza, but I've always loved their pasta dishes, delivered to my door in North York.
I've suffered through price increase after price increase, cancellation of coupons before their expiry date, and shrinking portions of lasagna and veal, but this time it's just too much!  I'm done!

The Linguine with a few strips of Veal and tomato sauce that I loved has steadily marched it's way up via numerous price increases to $15.99 over the past couple of years, but it's a large portion, so what the heck.  

However, when I tried to order it tonight, I discover that there's a new menu and it now costs $13.99 for plain linguine with Tomato sauce, plus $7.99 to add the veal ""topping"".
That's from $15.99 to $21.98 folks!  ... a 37% increase!
Let me note here that this is for simple supermarket dried pasta, with a simple tomato sauce and a few strips of breaded veal.

PLUS, two weeks ago they implemented a new $5 delivery charge to my area (formerly free!!).

Oh well, I'll not be supporting this new menu and the ridiculous price increases, and I emcourage others to make their views known as well.

Sadly, I suspect most will just suck it up and take it, and Dante will be laughing all the way to the bank.
